Hello I am Michael Hughes. I work as an IT Consultant in the Seattle, WA area and enjoy writing and
reading about technology among other things. Coding in the trenches is a place for me to write about
things that are interesting and hopefully helpful to other people in their pursuit of software
development.

Thanks for reading!
