The background on why this page exists are a pair of post (series) from the blog. One on [finance](/post/2025-10-15-0-percent-interest-loans "Does that 0% pay over time loan make sense?") and the other on using AI tools for software development, [for example.](/post/2025-10-03-misadventures-in-ai-clis-part-2 "(Mis)adventures in AI CLIs: Part 2 Confidently Building the Wrong Thing")

After this page is posted, roughly end of year 2025, there will be more posts about AI coming. The discussion on 0% APR purchase loans is complete though and the below calculator is the result. For the curious, the implementation and [README are over on Github.](https://github.com/msh9/apy-apr-tradeoff/tree/main)
