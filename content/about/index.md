Hello, my name is Michael Hughes. I currently reside in the Salt Lake City area and enjoy spending time ranging from home maintenance, being a father, running, and skiing. I have also worked in the technology parts of various industries
for over 11 years now, ranging from online travel to automotive manufacturing to public safety and, most recently, to financial services. Today I provide context and guidance for teams as an engineering manager and occasionally still do hands on work. 

Coding in the Trenches is a place where I generally write about technology-related subjects. Sometimes posts here are tips on specific technologies other times they are more in-depth pieces with general commentary on technology. I hope, at the very least, the blog is useful and sometimes entertaining.
