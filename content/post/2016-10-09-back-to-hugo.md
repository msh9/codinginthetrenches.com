Today's post will go over some of the reasons for why I switched my personal blog back to being generated via
a static generation tool from Wordpress. [I have previously written about not using static content tools]({{<ref "2014-02-26-from-dynamic-to-static-to-dynamic-or-why-my-blog-is-back-on-wordpress.md" >}})
, we'll look at some of the things that have changed in the last couple years with regards to complaints I had in 2014.

Using a static site generation tool can be [fraught with challenges]({{<ref "2016-09-24-screwing-up-my-site.md" >}}) for those that are not careful. Indeed, my personal blog has been broken in various ways for a portion of
 this last summer. In spite of the difficulties I have run into I will be staying with my static site based content tools for now.
