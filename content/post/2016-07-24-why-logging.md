It is a good practice to add logging capabilities to applications as they are built. There are a lot of good tutorials on how to setup logging within various applications and
software frameworks. It is also good though to discuss why something is a good practice since understanding the 'why' can lead to new insight in how, when, and where to apply
said 'thing.' The point of today's post is to discuss some scenarios for why application logging is important. This post will be mostly non-technical because the how of logging
can be learned with some decent web searches and there is already a wealth of information on logging software on the web.

In a few minutes of searching I didn't come across a formal definition for application logging. With that in mind, let's define a couple terms for this post:

- Logging is the exposure of internal application state via a representation which can be converted to text 
- A log is a description of some state of the application which generated the log.

A couple interesting points can be made on these, hopefully, intuitive formalizations. A log statement as simple as `I GOT HERE!` counts as a description of
the application's statement. It requires context to understand what "HERE" is, but nonetheless it is a description. The information generated by logging logic 
and the method of getting it out doesn't necessarily have to be text based. One example of a non-text logging component is
[journald][1] which accepts text and binary input and stores those inputs in a binary file. Why it is important to add logging capabilities to an application becomes 
a question of why are we (or other applications that we write!) interested in the state of a running application.

For those that are unfamiliar with the US' history of nuclear testing, the above photo is of the second test, baker, conducted during Operation Crossroads. The test is interesting to think about in the context
of reactive use of logs since it represents a gl...lkjsadfjfjllksadflksjflkdsajf something

At least in my case I'm often interested in the state of a running application when it reaches a state that it is not suppose to (be able to reach). The hypothetical horror story here
is some support engineering being woken as 03:00 in the morning by an alarm and needing to review an application's logs in order to determine how to quickly fix
the issue. Later in the day, a developer perhaps will also review application logs from the in order to understand why and where a failure occurred in the application.

In short, logs are needed in order to respond to failures. A log can be generated from an error thrown within frameworks that the application relies on or generated from logic
added by the application developer to indicate the application has reached an inappropriate state.

Without a developer survey, I cannot say with complete confidence that this is most common use case for logs, but it certainly seems like it.
