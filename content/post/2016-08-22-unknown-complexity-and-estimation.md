Developing new software involves resolving a frequently unknown quantity of problems of unknown complexity. Even when working on existing projects, new initiatives and features
can contain a unknown total amount of complexity. SCRUM and other related methodologies focus on relative estimation which has limitations when starting brand new work. 
Today's post looks at some of our limitations when it comes to estimation and what is implied by those limits.

At this point it verges on clich√© to remark how many commercial software projects run 'late' and over 'budget.' I find these kinds of statements odd, since, among other things, it implies that software
projects have accurately estimated finish dates and budgets in the first place--this is probably a dubious proposition in itself. Let us discuss the issue with long term due dates
before diving into the issue of unknown complexity and how to be 'okay' with it. 

Wikipedia has nice summary article listing a few [different software estimation methods.][1] It's an understatement to say that over the years there have been a variety of methods of generating
an estimate of how much a piece of software will cost. The range of methodologies is wide, ranging from those that claim to be based on long develop theories couched in mathematics to those
that rely on groups of experts giving a rough value off the top of their heads. In order of difficulty estimation of a software project, regardless of methodology, involves knowing the components
of work involved to complete the project and then actually developing an accurate estimate for the components of work.

Most non-toy software projects have components which are interdependent. In other words there is some amount of work which much be completed in order: part 1, part 2, part 3, and so on. The serial dependencies
can dominate a project's schedule because they cannot be completed faster by the application of larger teams ([though that has its own problems anyway][2]). A set of serial dependencies takes however long they will
take to get done regardless of team size. Other components of the project may be finished quickly, but the essential (and serial!) work remains regardless.

![An estimate for three serial items and other non-serial items](/images/2016-08-22-unknown-complexity/more-estimates.svg "Time estimates with other tasks")

Accurately estimating the time to completion and budget requires that an estimator or group of estimators roughly capture both the breadth of work to be done and the longest series of serial tasks. Unfortunately, 
software development tends to be an enterprise fraught with unknown unknowns. In other words, the discipline contains many components of work which are unknown, ie they are not evident as required tasks to the project
team, and are, secondarily, unknown because even if they were known they still contain an amount and type of work not familiar to the team. Many of the project overruns that I have seen or personally experienced have 
come to down to one or both of these unknown factors influencing the project's schedule.

![An estimate for three serial items with more unknowns](/images/2016-08-22-unknown-complexity/unknown-unknown.svg "Time estimates with unknowns")

The above diagram shows a near worst case scenario, known tasks take longer than estimated and there are a couple unknown tasks which also have to be completed. Above, several types of
unknown are on display, uncertainly in knowing the work involved in the project, uncertainly in the longest series of tasks, and uncertainly in the length of known tasks in the project. Together these kinds of 
unknowns make long term project planning challenging, perhaps impossible for large new projects. Returning to the opening point, a project is late or over budget only relative to some predetermined time or monetary value.
There are methodologies for project planning in the software estimation methods link above, they even including proprietary software that purports to use long tuned algorithms for accurately estimating projects. These 
methodologies all rely on the premise that future projects will resemble past projects and may, as a result, miss complexity present in new projects or features. 

Given unknown unknowns though, one approach, the approach I advocate for is to call a project finished when it's finished.

This is a rhetorical tautology. There is a relevant point here though.

The point is that at the beginning of a project it is vital to admit that the project is not finished (obviously) and that the finish date is essentially unknown. *Rough* estimates as provided by expert analysis or formal
methods are only useful as a way determining if the project is worth executing at all. These estimates should not be used as sell by dates because we need to admit that our
ability to estimate new work is limited and any precise looking estimates will likely be wrong. Again there is nothing wrong with estimating a 6 month effort in order to guess what it might cost and weigh it against
other 6 month estimates. A *rough* estimate that says a project will cost $10 million dollars is very useful if that same project is only estimated to return $40,000 in annual revenue--that estimate will have saved valuable
development resources. We get tripped up when we take what was a rough cost of project estimate (~$10 million dollars, ~6 months) and then tie explicit sales dates to that estimate, essentially
pinning the company's delivery reputation to a rough estimate of how long a project will take.

Don't promise large new features or new software 6 months or more in advance. Just don't do it.

I've previously written about Agile [methodologies and loss of fidelity in long term estimates][3] and the importance dealing with decreasing precision in long term estimates. As a very quick summary, if there is some
fixed date in the future then the delivered product must become fungible. 

![Balancing time cost versus getting things done](/images/2016-08-22-unknown-complexity/time-versus-components.svg "Time versus Getting Things Done")

My diagram again verges on being a rhetorical tautology. The point that getting more done takes more time can be lost in the midst of a project though. Encountering unexpected difficulties (unknowns as noted above)
or incorporating feature changes (more unknowns from the perspective of the development team) all mean more work; we then still maintain a fixed sales deadline in spite of accepting that more work will be done. Attempting
to borrow agile style estimates will not help with longer term planning. I repeat, story points and other relative complexity estimates *do not* help resolve the unknowns which can dominate a six month project schedule. 

This is where we have to [learn to love the bomb.][4]

Uncertainty means that at best we can construct a rough guideline by attempting to plan far into the future and at worst waste time, money, and effort developing a farce of reality whose cognitive dissonance with said reality damages
the enterprise involved. In the prior post related to agile I noted that only near term goals can be well defined and executed upon. Don Wells, whole published one of the original guides to extreme programming, has a take on 
["honest planning."][5] A honest plan being a plan that can reasonably be expected to be followed. Wells' honest planning hits on something very relevant to project uncertainties, that plans have expiration dates and notably
that those dates are measured in a small number of weeks.

The point of scrum's [backlog grooming meeting][6] is for understanding and estimating work for the next few weeks (the next sprint or two) using estimates derived from how large the next set of work is relative to prior work. 
The estimation techniques *are not* for figuring out the size of some task to be worked six months in the future. All is not lost though.

Once a project is greenlit because the **rough** long term estimates say it will net profit then it is possible to apply agile techniques. All of the familiar guidelines from agile are still valuable: releasing frequently, 
emphasizing communication with the project stakeholders, and using relative estimates. By focusing on frequent releases, near term estimates, and constant communication in order to determine value we avoid the some of the pitfuls
created by long term plans. It is not as if unknown unknowns do not exist in agile projects rather they are less of an issue because far fewer assumptions are made about the long term project effort. Finally, the project is 
(initially) done when the product owners feel it is ready which may be sooner rather than later for some projects and later rather than sooner for others; the point being that flexbile feature delivey makes the delivery
date movable to later or sooner than originally thought.

This was a long post on how we should be humble about estimation, particularly with long term estimates.
