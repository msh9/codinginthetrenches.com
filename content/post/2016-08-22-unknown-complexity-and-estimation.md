Developing new software involves resolving a frequently unknown quantity of problems of unknown complexity. Even when working on existing projects, new initiatives and features
can contain a unknown total amount of complexity. SCRUM and other related methodologies focus on relative estimation which has limitations when starting brand new work. 
Today's post looks at some of our limitations when it comes to estimation and thoughts on what is implied by those limits.

At this point it verges on clich√© to remark how many commercial software projects run 'late' and over 'budget.' I find these kinds of statements odd, since it implies that software
projects have accurately estimated finish dates and budgets in the first place--this is probably a dubious proposition in itself. Let us discuss the issue with long term due dates
before diving into the issue of unknown complexity. 

Wikipedia has nice summary article listing a few [different software estimation methods.][1] Some of them
