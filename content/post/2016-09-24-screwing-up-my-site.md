I enjoy running my own blog at [codinginthetrenches.com][1] because I am a technologist that likes to write. Unfortunately,
sometimes my interests as a technologist get the better of my interests as a writer. This last week my competitive interests
resulted in my blog being visually broken for several days. Furthermore, the competition has results in a few select articles being
mis-formatted and visually broken for much longer than a week. 

Today's post is about what I'll be doing to avoid these problems and how they can apply to your own writing platform.

My current and past employment has typically had me working in the area of web APIs and rich user applications (in the browser). I
typically work on back end, non-user facing code, but I also occasionally work on some front end systems as well. This background
is part of the reason is rather embarassing to admit that my personal website, where I write about such topics, was very broken for a
week and party broken for a couple **months**. 

First, some background, [a while back I wrote][2] about how I was switching *back* from a static site generator called Acrylamid to 
Wordpress. Fast forward roughly two and one-half years and now my blog is being published using another static site generation tool,
[Hugo][3] to be specific. I won't go into too much detail but suffice to say that Hugo is a "good enough" writing tool to replace
Wordpress and allows me to take advantage of static site advantages such as fast page load times and minimal security risks.

I've tried to migrate as much content between platforms as possible; at least a few posts have been through two content transformations, 
from restructured text to Wordpress and now to markdown. Perhaps unsurprisingly I have made some mistakes between changing platforms and
migrating content.

### Broken links, broken styles, pretty much broken everything.

This is probably the biggest web development sin that I have committed in the last week and couple months.
