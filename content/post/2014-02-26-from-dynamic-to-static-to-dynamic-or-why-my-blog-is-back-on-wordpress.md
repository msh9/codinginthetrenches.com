I recently migrated back to Wordpress as my blog platform of choice. The change has been painful, in fact, many of my older posts haven&#8217;t been migrated to WordPress. The change has been worth it though since it makes publishing easier. Today&#8217;s post is about the importance of focusing on the core workflows of an application and ensuring that they are as easy as possible to complete.

If I don&#8217;t want to think about how to use an application then I shouldn&#8217;t have to.

Okay maybe that is not entirely true; every new system will have a learning curve. Photoshop for example has a tremendous learning curve, it&#8217;s a professional application with a wide variety of features and capabilities.  That said, it&#8217;s still easy to open a photo, crop it, and then save it. The difficultly in Photoshop arises from trying to accomplish more complex tasks, in other words cropping a photo is easy while touching up a model&#8217;s eyelashes for a magazine print requires a solid grasp of Photoshop&#8217;s capabilities.

This post is not about Photoshop. It&#8217;s about why I&#8217;m back to using WordPress.

I became enamored with static site generators for some time, my site was generated with a tool called [acrylamid][1]. Arylamid is actually a very good tool in the sense that it does exactly what it purports to do: the fast, incremental generation of blogs from a variety of source markup formats. For a simple blog, static site generators have some nifty advantages:

  * The site source files usually remain in highly portable [I recently migrated back to Wordpress as my blog platform of choice.

  * The generated files (CSS, HTML, etc) are typically lightweight and can be served from anything ranging from S3 to IIS.
  * Creating new templates or blogs with static generators is generally very simple

That said, here I am back on WordPress and why is something that&#8217;s important for many user facing applications.

**The core workflows of an application should not be hard to accomplish.**

WordPress is a writing tool. I click a handful of buttons (less than 4) and write the content. Done. Static site generators, like acrylamid (still my personal favorite) don&#8217;t have the same level of ease of use. A tool being hard to use **isn&#8217;t** a knock against it in and of itself . Again, Photoshop has a tremendous learning curve, but is still a great tool for everything photo related. Instead the point is that tools should make [I recently migrated back to Wordpress as my blog platform of choice.

Again, Photoshop has a tremendous learning curve, but is still a great tool for everything photo related. Instead the point is that tools should make][4] You get the idea. Again this isn&#8217;t a knock against acrylamid or static site generators in general, many people use them to great effect and additionally acrylamid has a very specific target audience that wants the above features more than it wants an easy to use GUI. I would posit though that for an average user it is more challenging to use acrylamid than it is to use WordPress(.com).

Essentially I have moved my blog back to WordPress because it doesn&#8217;t make me do this when writing a post:<figure id="attachment_57" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="wp-image-57 size-full" src="http://codinginthetrenches.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/497374910_9d8bfb7898_o-e1417402428878.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" />][5]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo By [umjanedoan][6] / [CC By 2.0][7]</figcaption></figure> 

Is there a takeaway from this post? Why yes there is. A good user facing application (that is really any application internally or externally that has human users) must make the core purpose of the application at least intelligible. I have poked at [this topic before][8], but it&#8217;s so important that I&#8217;m going to mention it again from my own perspective. I originally used static site generators because I placed value on keeping my original text content in restructured text format and acrylamid **made this easy**. Similarly I am back to WordPress now because I have (much) less time to write and therefore value ease of post creation and publishing, something that WordPress **makes really easy. **Continuing this theme there are [other examples][9] of [easier to use][10] products and more [customer centric][11] policies doing better with consumers. Admittedly the later two of those linked articles are more opinion than fact, but you get the idea.

In short: If you&#8217;re building a tool that solves a problem make sure that the tool makes it easier (or just possible) to solve that problem.
