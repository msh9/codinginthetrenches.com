Today's post is short essay concerning the value of development led quality. There are no code examples or short tips for things
in this post. I hope you enjoy.

Imagine for a moment a teacher instructing his or her students to phone it in on a single assignment. Now imagine that same
instructor giving that same direction for every assignment and project in the class. The student's joy of getting off easy once
or twice may eventually meld into cynicism about the class' instructor and disdain for the course in general. For those of us
who have attended a University this sort of class may be known as the easy way to get some credit in order to raise grades, not
to learn something. Asking for a particular level of quality sets the tone for both the instruction and the class.

This is, of course, literally academic. In the experiences I have had in professional settings the ease with which someone passed
through courses is sometimes seem as a badge of honor. If not that then at the least the difficulty or lack there of in an individual's education is
significantly less important than the work entailed by his or her current position. As it should be. It is problematic then that 
it is not hard to draw parallels between the mediocre, half-hearted, effort of a *gimme* course and what gets asked of developers. Too often
the ideas behind agile development get twisted into program directions that lose sight of the fact that MVP stands for minimum **viable** 
product.

Asking a product team to intentionally reduce quality in order to meet a deadline is a great way to ruining moral and take the wind out of the team.
