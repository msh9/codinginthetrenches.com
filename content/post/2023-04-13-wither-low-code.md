Should organizations that need to build software care about low code? Should they ever have cared about low code? Will code be the future of how software is built? Will large language models trained to write code based on text prompts replace all developers? Do I have answers to these questions?

Nope, but I can still editorialize.

It's spring of 2023, it would be almost irresponsible for me to write post on a technology focused blog without mentioning the following phrases: large language model (LLM), generative AI, AI, or just 'ChatGPT'. The commercialization hype machine for AI is in full swing. One of the high profile companies, OpenAI, has even published a white paper about how technology, like the ones they sell, will be used in 100s of millions of jobs. *News that company uses technology, **X**, they sell to prove that **X** is tranformative and will be used by many at 11.* 

Let's chat first about something that was predicted by purveyers of said technologies to reduce need for expensive developers for years now. Low code.

I have experience with low code tools both as a developer and as a manager responsible for teams. They work, but not in the way they are advertised. First, what am I talking about,

- Tools advertised as allowing users to create applications using (possibly a web) user interface
- Tools advertised as allowing users to create applications without developer involvement
- Tools advertised as allowing users to create applications without code

Let's suppose I have a system which processes some kind of workflow. It could be a workflow that replaced a paper and signature based approval process like project approval. We could alternatively be talking about a workflow that integrates spreadsheets from multiple people as part of a end of quarter financial statement workflow. Perhaps on a more technical level we're need to define a workflow that controls how users are allowed to log into a system. 

The handful of low code systems I've worked with have been designed for creating one or more *workflows.* To the extent that low code tools work as advertised, they do help accelerate the initial development of systems. Sometimes this works over the long term, some times it doesn't.
