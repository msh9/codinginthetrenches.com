Summary
    The history of end user computing appears to consist mostly of a 
    slow push of more and more computing power out to end users. Even
    a modestly old desktop can run circles around the workstations of
    the 1980s. At this point is all that power really needed? The point
    of this post is to discuss past (and maybe a near future?) ways that
    desktop users could get along without even a laptop.
