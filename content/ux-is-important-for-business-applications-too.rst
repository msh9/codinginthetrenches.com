One of the hardest parts about building software for people is the
people. The last couple projects I have worked on have been user
oriented data exploration tools (generally speaking, one was for a
marketing group and the other was for an automotive firm). In both cases
there were two overarching questions that had to be answered for every
feature we implemented. The questions were what would a new feature do
and how would a user use the new feature. In a version of form over
function we discovered that a number of times *how a user* would use a
feature to find data would influence how it *needed to be implemented*.

The difficultly with working on end user facing applications is that the
coolest, best feature in the world isn't worth very much if is not clear
how to use it. On some level the importance of UX is obvious with
consumer facing applications. It's why interface changes to popular
pieces of software such as Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office cause
so much commotion. The importance of UX in enterprise applications,
however is also deserving of the same focus. At one point or another
workers at large enterprises have likely had the (dis)pleasure of
working with badly designed user interfaces for internal applications.
It's unfortunate that in the enterprise scenario UX is less important
due a combination of tighter budgets, forced adoption, and short
schedules.

Users can be asked to use a specific application in the enterprise
scenario even if it is poorly designed and hard to use. The results of
forced use of enterprise applications may be not ideal or as great as
hoped. A project my company was brought in to help save was plagued by a
buggy and slowly web UI. The project was an information portal for
internal use, it looked nice, but the core workflows of the application
didn't match user expectations resulting in complaints and users
choosing to ignore the (expensive) application in favor of older
systems. In other more extreme cases where the new application is
intended to replace an old workflow a poor user experience may result in
little or no user adoption. A poorly designed UI may result in fewer
time or accuracy savings than might have been otherwise anticipated even
if internal users adopt an application.

The point is that getting user experience right is hard and it should be
considered an important part of internal enterprise application
development.

    How do we get it right?

you might say. The answer unfortunately lies somewhere between
approaching business applications like consumer applications and hiring
a UX/\ `IA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture>`__
consultancy. It will involve:

-   **Asking the target users** what they do to accomplish a business
   process and **not** assuming that individuals' managers know the end
   to end workflows.
-  **Creating mocks** that demonstrate what an application **will** do
   before actually building it
-  Let the target audience **use the application before** it's finished
   in order to give feedback on the design
-  **Listen** to how existing processes work and don't prescribe new
   ways of accomplishing goals (at least not without solid evidence)

After following the above bullets points and hiring a good consultancy
your application will still likely get it wrong. `Iterative
development <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development>`__\ models
are important because it takes time to apply the above ideas and figure
out how to correctly interact with enterprise users and automate
processes. Taking the time to get it right though may be the difference
between your users feeling like they're working on a teletype connected
to a 60s era mainframe and users appreciating productivity enhancing
internal applications build for the 21st century.
