title: Nginx server_name directive: Commas and Spaces

While moving this blog over to a new host, blog system, and format I decided
to use Nginx_ as my content server. In order to use Nginx I needed to setup
multiple server_ blocks that would host the content for multiple domains
(roughly the equivalent of creating Apache HTTPD vhosts). One of
directives the Nginx uses to determine which server block to process a request
with is the server_name_ directive.

Now for the tip: When using the server_name directive ensure that domain names
are **space** separated. For example::

    server {
        server_name codinginthetrenches.com www.codinginthetrenches.com
        ...
    }

I initially (and erroneously) comma separated the domain names. Interestingly
using comma separated values in the server_name directive will not stop Nginx from
starting nor will it throw an error. When domains are comma separated Nginx will
serve all requests from the first server block defined in it's configuration file.

I don't blame the software for this since *it is* documented in the
server_name_ documentation--I just wish there had been a warning thrown so I
didn't spend so much time tracking down my own typo.
