Summary
    After reviewing higher level abstractions like EcpliseLink_and TopLink_ for tieing a service application to a database
    I chose to use jOOQ_ because of its flexibility and ability to provide tight control over the SQL being executed in the application's
    data layer.

I recently start work on a new project that involved a Java application stack running on top of a MySQL database.
