I like Vim; its simple when I want it to be and smart when needed. If I need to write some C for a project, Vim intelligently handles indenting, line wrapping, bracket balancing, and syntax highlighting. Similarly when I need to jot a quick note, Vim starts quickly, saves a file in 3 key strokes, and generally gets out of my way.

I use Vim almost exclusively in a terminal emulator, such as konsole which in turn lives within a larger GUI environment. Often I find that I need to copy paste from elsewhere into Vim, for exampleÂ  a URL from firefox in a quick note in Vim. Other times I need to paste large blocks of text with pre-existing indentations. The console version of Vim (as opposed to gvim) has no way of distinguishing between text that is pasted and text that is typed, so any pre-existing indentation may become malformed depending on the indentation rules in use by Vim at that moment.

Fortunately Vim has a way around the paste problem, paste mode. Paste mode tries to handle pasted (go figure) text more intelligently, by among other things, turning off auto-indentation. The simple way of turning on paste mode:

#. Enter normal mode, generally by pressing ``<esc>``
#. Type ``:set paste``


To turn off paste mode:

#. Enter normal mode, generally by pressing ``<esc>``
#. Type ``:set nopaste``


There is an even easier thing to do, since this is a common operation it can be easy assigned to a specific key, often <F2>, but others can be used this is done by:

#. Open the .vimrc file, most likely in your home directoy on linux, ``vim ~/.vimrc``
#. Add the following to a newline: ``set pastetoggle=<F2>``
#. Save the .vimrc file and close Vim


The ``<F2>`` key will now conviently toggle paste mode on and off as needed.

More information can be found by accessing Vim's internal help system in normal mode, or visiting the following links:

-  ``:help paste``
-  ``:help pastetoggle``
