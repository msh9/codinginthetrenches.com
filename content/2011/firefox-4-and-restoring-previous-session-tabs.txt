I like the new Firefox 4. I occasionally do web development on the side so I have installed and use a variety of browsers ranging from the relatively obscure Opera to the venerable IE7 (IE6 doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned). Even though Chrome (and IE9 too) have surpassed Firefox in some ways it's still the browser I use on a daily basis.

I still use Firefox because it's native to all the platforms I have, it's easy to share my profile information around, and more importantly I'm used to it. One feature I used a lot in FF3.x was the dialog which asked to save my open tabs when I closed the browser. Conceptually this seems like a useless feature, if a URL was important enough to keep open across sessions, it should be bookmarked, if not, then I could always find it again. In practice, I found the feature indispensable; while working on software projects I'd keep tabs open with information pertinent to the project but that I wouldn't otherwise bookmark. Being able to save open tabs meant I could close the browser to do something else without losing track of my work.

In FF4.x the convenient dialog has been simplified and obvious access to the save tab feature was removed. Do not fear though the functionality is still there and now tabs are always saved (from the main window at least). To access tabs from a previous session just open the **History** menu and then click on **Restore Previous Session**. Or pictorially:

`|Firefox Restore Previous Session menu item| <http://mhughes.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ff_restore_prev_session.png>`_\ There are actually several ways to emulate the old FF3.x behavior. I like the new menu item because it minimizes shutdown dialogs and restores the previous session when I need to, but doesn't otherwise.

For information about this method see the `developer's post about it. <http://blog.zpao.com/post/1099464627/restore-previous-session>`_

Other methods to emulate the old functionality include:

-  Restoring the old FF3.x shutdown dialog as discussed `here <http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/786128#answer-139770>`_
-  Or having Firefox *always* restore the old session as documented `here <http://support.mozilla.com/ar/questions/822709>`_.
