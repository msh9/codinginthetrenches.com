Hello, my name is Michael Hughes. I currently reside in the Salt Lake
City area and enjoy various hobbies ranging from home brewing to skiing.
Although, having recently purchased a house, pursuits like furniture
finishing, painting, and plumbing have become interesting to me as well.

Currently I work at `Motorola Solutions
Inc. <http://www.motorolasolutions.com/>`__, helping to build a scalable
micro-services platform. My primary work experience is in API design,
AWS application deployments, implementing Java and NodeJS based web
services. I have also worked on ASP.Net web applications and frontend
code using frameworks like AngularJS and Knockout. For work inquiries
please reach out to me on LinkedIn (below) or `contact me via
email <mailto:work@mihughes.com>`__

Coding in the trenches is a place where I generally write about
technically related subjects; some times posts here are tips on specific
technologies, other times posts here are longer winded pieces with
general commentary on technology. Hopefully, at the very least, the blog
is useful and sometimes entertaining.
