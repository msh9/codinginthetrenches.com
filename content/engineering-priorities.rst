A (really) short post on the priorities of hobby projects, 1st draft
projects, final production grade ap­pli­ca­tions.

--------------

As per the post tag the below is only 1/4 serious and 3/4 for fun-

Hobby / 1st drafts:

#. Novelty (Can I use this new shiny thing?)
#. Per­for­mance (Can I make this new shiny thing go faster too??)
#. Re­li­a­bil­i­ty (Oh yeah–it fails sometimes, but I just restart it.)
#. Cor­rect­ness (Wait you mean it was supposed to solve problem X and
   **not** problem Y???)

As in: *I want to try something new that’s fast, usually works, and
normally returns me the right thing (for what I thought I was solving).*

A serious hobby ap­pli­ca­tion might look like the following:

#. Cor­rect­ness (My problem is solved!)
#. Per­for­mance (Pretty fast too!)
#. Novelty (I used this nifty new Python module)
#. Re­li­a­bil­i­ty (It may only work on my desktop computer at
   home though)

As in: *I fixed my personal problem with this specific solution that
works pretty well–if you deviate even slightly outside my re­quire­ments
it will probably break.*

Final Production Grade:

#. Cor­rect­ness (Our sales force is better leveraged–sales went up 15%)
#. Re­li­a­bil­i­ty (The app is important to business sales, give me 99%
   uptime–that’s ~3.65 days / year of downtime by the way)
#. Per­for­mance (It needs to go just fast enough to get the job done)
#. Novelty (Your platform choices are Java 1.6, JBoss 6, Spring 3.1.0,
   and Hibernate 4–wait did we say ‘choices’?)

Obviously not all ap­pli­ca­tions follow this pattern. There are many
hobby ap­pli­ca­tions that evolve into production grade ap­pli­ca­tions
used by en­ter­pris­es (the linux kernel for example). Similarly there
are production ap­pli­ca­tions that value per­for­mance over
re­li­a­bil­i­ty, witness some of the issues in the last couple years
with high frequency trading software. As the tag mentions, all just
for fun.
